# Changelog

All notable changes to EmbedMind are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org) (pre-1.0: minor bumps may break APIs, but **never** the
file format without a migration path).

**Honesty policy:** regressions, data-integrity incidents, and benchmark losses are
recorded here, not buried. If a release fixes a corruption bug, the entry links a
postmortem.

## [Unreleased]

Pre-v0.1 — under active development, repo private until M1 completes
(see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).

### Added
- **Graceful recall on `.mind` files with no full-text index** (S9 edge,
  roadmap 2.3) — a file written before the full-text index existed (header's
  `fts_root_page == 0`) never fails `recall`: it degrades to vector-only
  automatically (RRF fusion with an empty text list) and the degradation is
  now *visible*, not silent — the CLI prints a stderr warning pointing at
  `embedmind vacuum` (which rebuilds the file with the index) and the MCP
  `recall` response gains a top-level `warning` field, absent on healthy
  files so existing clients see an unchanged shape. Covered end-to-end: a
  core integration test opens a legacy-shaped fixture and asserts valid
  vector hits + the outcome flag, CLI and MCP tests assert the warning on
  their channels, and the S9 fusion invariants (union never intersection,
  deterministic best-first order, limit cap) are now property-tested with
  `proptest` — closing story S9.
- **Real head-to-head benchmark numbers vs. sqlite-vec + zvec** — the comparison
  columns the harness reserved are now filled with measured values (no more
  "not measured on this run"). Ran `benches/run_all.sh` with
  `--features compare-sqlite-vec,compare-zvec` on the founder's Windows box (MSVC
  toolchain), same vectors/queries/`k`, on `agent-mem-10k`: sqlite-vec
  **0.1.10-alpha.4** (recall@10 0.9984, query p99 13.2 ms, 15.3 MiB) and zvec
  **0.5.1** (recall@10 0.9912, query p99 1.5 ms, 17.4 MiB). Both beat EmbedMind
  on warm-query p99 and on-disk size (they store bare vectors; EmbedMind keeps
  the memory text + metadata + provenance), and sqlite-vec edges out recall —
  recorded in the losses list per the honesty contract (BENCHMARKS.md §4).
  Competitor metrics now also land in `benches/results/<version>.json` so every
  table cell traces to a field. A `COMPARE_DATASET` env var pins the (expensive)
  comparison to the 10k set while the full EmbedMind 10k+100k table and its NFR
  verdicts (all passing: recall p99 15.5 ms, peak RAM 281 MiB @ 100k) still run.
  The zvec adapter's directory pre-creation bug (zvec rejects a pre-existing
  collection path) was fixed.
- **Python bindings** (S12 / task B5, roadmap 2.5) — the multiplier that
  unlocks LangChain and custom agents. New `bindings/python` crate (PyO3 +
  maturin, its own workspace like `fuzz`) exposes `Store` with
  `remember`/`recall`/`forget`/`stats`/`vacuum` at the **same semantics** as the
  MCP tools and CLI: a thin shell over `embedmind_core::api`, no domain logic
  (CLAUDE.md decision 2). Typed metadata maps to native Python scalars
  (`str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`/`None`); recall filters accept an exact-match
  scalar or a `(min, max)` numeric range (S10), the agent filter and per-agent
  stats breakdown (S14) come through unchanged. Because the bindings call the
  *same* engine, `.mind` files are **byte-for-byte interchangeable** with the
  Rust `Store` — a pytest round-trip suite writes in Rust and reads in Python
  (and vice-versa, incl. forget across the boundary) to prove it. Ships as an
  `abi3` wheel (one per platform, CPython 3.9+) with the embedded ONNX model, so
  vector recall works on `pip install` with no download or API key; type stubs +
  `py.typed` included. Release CI builds/tests the three-platform wheels (PyPI
  upload stays MANUAL, like crates.io); CI lints + pytests the bindings on every
  PR.
- **Basic provenance exposed: agent filter on recall + per-agent stats
  breakdown** (S14 / task C2, roadmap 3.2) — the agent/session data every
  memory already carried (core decision 3) is now queryable, with no file-format
  change. `recall` gains an optional agent filter (`Query::agent`), applied in
  the same `keep` predicate as scope/tombstone/metadata filters, so it composes
  with them and keeps the S2 adaptive-`ef_search` anti-under-return guarantee
  across the vector, text and hybrid paths. `stats` gains `StoreStats::by_agent`
  — a breakdown of **live** memories per writing agent (empty agent = unknown
  provenance), each with its distinct session ids. Shells: the MCP `recall` tool
  takes an optional `agent` argument (additive, backward compatible) and a new
  **read-only `stats` tool** reports the live/forgotten counts and the per-agent
  breakdown; the CLI adds `recall --agent <name>` and a "by agent" section in
  `embedmind stats`. Attestation and full history/time-travel stay explicitly
  out of scope (founder decision, post-traction). Spec: `docs/01-spec.md` S14.
- **Graph layer: explicit entities + typed relations between memories** (S13 /
  task C1, roadmap 3.1, **ADR 0012**) — the vector + text + **graph** depth no
  embedded memory engine has complete. `remember` accepts entity tags
  (`MemoryDraft::entity`, 1–128 bytes) and typed relations to existing live
  memories (`MemoryDraft::relation`; a missing or forgotten target is a typed
  error — dangling edges are never born), written in the *same transaction* as
  the record: graph pages (new `GRAPH_DICT`/`GRAPH_OVERFLOW` types, spec in
  FORMAT.md §12, `format_version` 2 → 3, additive) ride the WAL like every
  other page. Navigation: `Store::related(id)` (both directions, kind carried),
  `Store::entity_members(entity)`, `Store::entities_of(id)`; optional 1-hop
  expansion on recall (`Query::expand_related`) appends connected context after
  the ranked hits (score 0.0, outside the limit). Relations to a forgotten
  memory disappear with the tombstone (re-checked at query time) and are
  physically dropped by `vacuum`, which rebuilds the graph keeping only live
  entities and edges with both ends live. The dictionary reuses the same
  slotted B-tree as the full-text index (shared `index::dict` module — one
  fuzzed implementation, not two). Extraction is explicitly *not* in scope:
  entities/relations are caller-provided. New fuzz target `fuzz_graph_page`
  (+ seed corpus); the record crash harness now writes and verifies graph
  pages at every injected kill point. Older (v2) files degrade to "no related
  memories", never an error. The whole layer is exposed through the shells
  (the product surface, CLAUDE.md decision 1): the MCP `remember` tool takes
  `entities` (string array) and `relations` (`{kind, target}` array), `recall`
  takes `expand_related: true`, and a new **`related` tool** navigates by
  `id` **or** `entity` (exactly one); the CLI mirrors it with `remember
  --entity NAME --relation KIND=ID`, `recall --expand-related` (connected
  context printed with a `rel` marker instead of a score) and a `related
  <ID> | --entity NAME` subcommand. Protocol and end-to-end CLI tests cover
  the flow, including the tombstone edge through both shells.
- `embedmind vacuum` reclaims forgotten space for real (S11 / task B4, roadmap
  2.x, **ADR 0003**), replacing the earlier explicit "not implemented" error.
  Rebuild **by copy, never in place**: a fresh `.mind` is built in a sibling temp
  file with every *live* memory re-inserted (record preserved byte-for-byte —
  id, provenance, metadata — while the HNSW and full-text indexes are rebuilt
  from scratch so they hold only the living), then swapped over the original with
  a single **atomic rename**. Crash-safe at every point: until the rename the
  original is untouched, so a crash leaves either the intact original or the
  finished compacted file — never a torn mix; orphan temp/scratch files are swept
  on the next `open`/`vacuum`. Result is always ≤ the original in size. `Store`
  gains a `Vfs::rename` seam and the swap parks its live pager on a throwaway
  scratch store so the file field is never invalid mid-swap. `embedmind vacuum`
  now prints the before/after size and the count reclaimed. New crash harness
  `tests/crash_vacuum.rs` sweeps a kill point at every mutating I/O of the vacuum
  and asserts recovery lands in exactly one of the two legal states (and that
  both are exercised). **Note (pre-existing, unrelated bug found while testing):**
  a crash *during a checkpoint* (independent of vacuum, reproducible via a plain
  `close()` mid-checkpoint) can drop a committed `forget`; tracked separately —
  see the session notes. `docs/adr/0003`.
- Metadata filters on `recall` (S10 / task B3, roadmap 2.4): `recall` accepts a
  `key → filter` map, ANDed — exact typed match (`Filter::Eq`) or numeric range
  (`Filter::Range { min, max }`). Filters ride the same `keep` predicate as the
  tombstone/scope re-check, so the S2 adaptive-`ef_search` anti-under-return
  guarantee covers filtered results (a filtered-out candidate widens the search,
  never silently under-returns). Edges: a filter on an absent key is a plain
  non-match (0 hits, never an error); a type-incompatible filter (`Eq` across
  types, or `Range` over a non-numeric value) is a typed `InvalidArgument`. The
  MCP `recall` tool schema gains an **optional** `filters` object (bare scalar =
  equality, `{min?, max?}` = range) — additive and backward compatible for
  clients that never send it; the CLI adds a repeatable `recall --filter`
  (`key=value`, `key=lo..hi`, `key>=n`, `key<=n`). Shells stay logic-free
  (parse → API → serialize). Spec: `docs/01-spec.md` S10.
- Hybrid recall: fuse the vector and full-text lists via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
  (S9 recall half, roadmap 2.3, ADR 0005, k=60) in `recall::fuse`, wired into
  `Store::recall`/`recall_detailed`. Fusion is a union, never an intersection: a
  rare exact term (text-only hit) or a semantic synonym (vector-only hit) both
  still make the result. A pre-M2 file with no full-text index (`format_version`
  1) degrades to vector-only with a reported flag, never an error; project
  scope, tombstone re-check, and the S2 adaptive-`ef_search` anti-under-return
  guarantee are preserved end-to-end. Fixed `fuse` double-counting a repeated id
  within a single list (tracks per-id list contribution so an intra-list repeat
  keeps only its best rank, while a genuine cross-list overlap still sums). New
  `Store::recall_vector` isolates the pure HNSW path so the benchmark harness
  keeps grading the index's approximation quality on its own
  (`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` §3) now that `recall` itself is hybrid.
- Full-text index in the engine (S9 engine half, roadmap 2.3, **ADR 0011**):
  own paged inverted index with BM25 scoring — **not** an embedded tantivy,
  which would break the single-file promise and the WAL's single commit truth.
  Two new page types (`FTS_DICT` 0x08, `FTS_POSTINGS` 0x09) and a `fts_root_page`
  header field carried in previously-reserved bytes, so `format_version` moves
  1 → 2 as an **additive** bump: a v1 `.mind` stays readable and simply has no
  full-text index (`recall` degrades to vector-only). `remember` indexes content
  in the same transaction as the record and vector writes (crash-safe by the
  same WAL); `Store::search_text` exposes BM25 keyword search (tombstone/scope
  filtered like vector recall) — the list that will fuse with the vector list
  via RRF (ADR 0005) in the recall half of S9. New fuzz target `fuzz_fts_page`;
  the record crash harness now exercises the FTS pages through recovery.
  Spec: `docs/FORMAT.md` §11.
- Launch-ready README + 30s demo GIF script (M1 item 1.7 / A4):
  - README marked **v0.1** (pre-v0.1 warning dropped); a dedicated **Install**
    section (prebuilt binary from Releases, `cargo install embedmind`, source
    build) split from the **Quickstart**; the real `agent-mem-10k` benchmark
    table rendered from `benches/results` (recall@10 0.9953, query p99 17.1 ms,
    `remember` p99 16.7 ms, 82 MiB file, ~112 MiB RSS) with the honesty caveats
    (embed-included ingest, competitors not measured this run, 100k NFRs
    pending); a "When to use sqlite-vec instead" section; and full-text/graph
    claims scoped to the roadmap so nothing unshipped is promised as v0.1.
  - `docs/launch/gif-script.md`: exact command sequence + timing for the 30s
    demo (remember → semantic recall → stats), all commands drawn from the
    shipped quickstart. Recording itself stays `[MANUAL — founder]`.
- Full benchmark harness (M1 item 1.7 / A3 part 2, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`):
  - `embedmind-bench` now measures the complete metric set — recall@10 vs.
    brute-force, warm query p50/p99, cold-open (`Store::open` + first query),
    `remember` p50/p99 end-to-end (incl. embedding), ingest throughput, on-disk
    file size, and peak RSS — over the committed `agent-mem-10k`/`-100k` datasets.
  - Competitors (sqlite-vec, zvec) are compared in **pinned, recorded versions**
    (`benches/src/competitors.rs`) behind `--features compare-{sqlite-vec,zvec}`.
    When a native toolchain is absent the row reports "not measured on this run
    (target vX.Y)" — the honesty contract forbids fabricated numbers
    (BENCHMARKS.md §4 rule 1).
  - `run_all` binary + `benches/run_all.sh` render a README-ready markdown table
    (with an auto-computed "where EmbedMind loses" section) plus a
    `results/<version>.json`, and exit non-zero on any missed applicable NFR, so
    the same entry point is the CI performance guard (BENCHMARKS.md §5).
  - **Measured v0.1-dev numbers** (founder Windows dev box, CPU-only,
    single-thread): `agent-mem-10k` → recall@10 0.9953, query p99 17.1 ms,
    `remember` p99 16.7 ms (NFR < 200 ms ✅), file 82 MiB, peak RSS ~112 MiB.
    The @100k NFRs (recall p99 < 50 ms, RAM < 300 MB) are validated by the
    `agent-mem-100k` run — see docs/BENCHMARKS.md for the recorded result.
- crates.io publication metadata (M1 item 1.6, story S8): `description`,
  `repository`, `homepage`, `keywords`, `categories`, `readme` and
  `license = "MIT"` on `embedmind-core`, `embedmind-mcp` and `embedmind`
  (the CLI crate), a per-crate `README.md` for each, and inter-crate deps
  pinned with both `path` and `version` in `[workspace.dependencies]`.
  Mandatory publish order (core → mcp → cli), the `[MANUAL — founder]`
  steps, and the crates.io 10 MiB size-limit caveat for the embedded ONNX
  model are documented in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).
- Release pipeline for pre-built binaries (M1 item 1.6, story S8;
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`):
  - Triggered by a `v*` tag; runs the full `cargo test --workspace` suite on
    Linux/Windows/macOS as a gate, then builds the release binary
    (LTO + `codegen-units=1` + strip, from the root `Cargo.toml`) on each
    platform, smoke-tests `embedmind --version`, and attaches one compressed
    artifact per OS to the tag's GitHub Release.
  - `workflow_dispatch` against a tag is a dry run — it produces the same
    workflow artifacts but never mutates a Release (publication is a founder
    action, `docs/04-agents.md` guardrail 7).
  - The job fails if any artifact exceeds the 40 MB ceiling.
- CLI with a working command surface (M1 item 1.6):
  - `embedmind remember / recall / forget / stats` over the default
    `~/.embedmind/memory.mind` (or `--file`); `remember`/`recall` respect
    the detected project context (`--project` / `--global` / `--all`
    override it); `stats` reports counts, file layout, index entries and
    the recorded embedding model (new `Store::stats` / `StoreStats` API).
  - `embedmind serve` runs the same MCP server as the `embedmind-mcp`
    binary — one installed command covers standalone use and the agent
    integration (`claude mcp add embedmind -- embedmind serve`).
  - `embedmind vacuum` fails with an explicit "not implemented, planned
    for v0.2" instead of pretending.
  - End-to-end tests drive the real binary, including a full MCP session
    through `serve` via stdio pipes.
- MCP memory server (M1 items 1.4 + 1.5, `docs/adr/0009`):
  - Direct stdio JSON-RPC implementation — no SDK, no tokio; covers
    `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. Protocol errors are
    typed JSON-RPC codes; engine failures during a tool call are tool
    results with `isError: true`, never a server crash.
  - Tools `remember` / `recall` / `forget` with stable schemas; zero
    domain logic in the shell. `clientInfo.name` from the handshake is
    recorded as the provenance agent.
  - Automatic project-context scoping: the nearest marker walking up from
    the cwd wins — `.embedmind.toml` with a top-level `project` key
    (explicit override), else a `.git` entry (repo root's directory name).
    `remember` stamps the detected project (`project: null` forces
    global); `recall` scopes to it by default, `scope: "all"` is the
    explicit fallback, and the applied scope is echoed back.
- Vector recall (M1 item 1.3, `docs/adr/0002` + `0004` + `0008`):
  - Paged HNSW with **direct page addressing**: adjacencies store node
    page numbers — no id-to-page table, fixed-size meta page forever,
    O(M) pages touched per insert, no node-count cap. Diversity-aware
    neighbor selection (the paper's Algorithm 4 + keepPrunedConnections)
    and adaptive `ef_search` (grows ×4 while filters leave the result
    under-filled, up to the whole graph).
  - Embedded ONNX embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 int8 (~23 MB) + tokenizer
    compiled into the binary via `ort` (CPU-only) — no API key, no
    download step, nothing leaves the machine. Model id + dims recorded
    in the header; opening with a mismatched model is refused.
  - Long-content chunking at the index level: text past one 510-token
    window is embedded in overlapping windows (64-token overlap, cap 128
    chunks); each chunk is one more HNSW entry pointing at the same
    record, search dedupes by record id, recall returns the whole memory.
  - `Store::recall(Query)` with `Scope::All`/`Scope::Project` and
    per-query `ef_search`; hits are `Recalled` (memory + cosine score).
    Tombstoned and out-of-scope memories are re-checked against the
    record at search time, never trusted from the graph.
- New dependencies: `ort` + `tokenizers` (embeddings, isolated behind
  `trait Embedder`), `serde_json` (MCP/CLI shells only — the binary
  format still does not use serde). All within the DESIGN §10 budget.
- KV store + public Rust API (M1 item 1.2):
  - `record`: on-disk `MemoryRecord` encoding exactly per
    [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md) §5 — ULID ids, tombstone flag, project
    scope, basic provenance (agent/session/timestamp), typed metadata
    scalars. Every length prefix is validated before allocation; decoding
    arbitrary bytes never panics.
  - `storage::btree`: record B-tree per FORMAT.md §5.1 — slotted leaves,
    fixed-entry inner nodes, provably-safe byte-midpoint splits, overflow
    chains for records above ~usable/4 bytes (hard cap 32 MiB), in-order
    scan. No delete: `forget` is a tombstone update; orphaned overflow
    chains wait for `embedmind vacuum` (documented leak).
  - `api::Store`: `create`/`open`/`open_or_create`, `remember` (one durable
    transaction per call), `get`, `forget` (tombstone; no-op forgets write
    zero bytes), timeline iteration (`iter`/`iter_all`), clean `close`.
    Custom `Vfs` injection stays available for tests and embedders.
- Fuzzing infrastructure (rest of M1 item 1.8, per
  [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) §3):
  - The five planned targets — `fuzz_header`, `fuzz_page`, `fuzz_record`,
    `fuzz_wal_replay`, `fuzz_open_full` — as thin wrappers over
    `embedmind-core::fuzz` bodies, which also run as stable smoke tests in
    `cargo test` on every platform (libFuzzer itself is Linux-only in CI).
  - Seed corpus generated from real encoder output
    (`cargo run --example gen_fuzz_corpus`), committed under `fuzz/corpus/`;
    `fuzz/regressions/` reserved for minimized crash inputs.
  - CI: short pass (2 min/target) on every PR, nightly scheduled job
    (1h/target), corpus accumulated across runs via cache.
- Record-level crash harness (`tests/crash_records.rs`): the §2 injection
  sweep re-run against the public API (remember/forget/reopen workloads over
  splits, overflow chains and tombstones), with invariant I5 checked against
  a content-keyed reference model. Verified to catch a deliberately injected
  missing-fsync bug (all three sweeps fail with reproducing tuples).
- New dependency: `ulid` (id generation — already in the DESIGN §10 budget).
- Storage layer foundation (M1 items 1.1 + 1.8, built together as
  [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) mandates):
  - `format`: `.mind` header (page 0) and WAL framing exactly per
    [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md) — little-endian, explicitly serialized,
    xxh3 checksums on every page, version policy (G4) and encrypted-flag
    refusal implemented as typed errors.
  - `storage::vfs`: `trait Vfs`/`VfsFile`, the I/O seam; `RealVfs` with
    positional I/O and advisory locking (`LockFileEx` on Windows).
  - `storage::wal` + `storage::pager`: physical page WAL (commit = append
    frames + fsync + valid commit frame), automatic recovery on every open
    (torn tails discarded, committed prefix applied), checkpointing at 4 MB
    or clean close, single-writer lock, transactions with rollback-by-drop.
  - `storage::sim`: in-memory fault-injecting VFS — kill points before/after
    every mutating I/O op, sector-granular torn writes, lying-fsync mode.
  - Crash-test harness (`tests/crash.rs`): full injection sweep over four
    workloads, invariants I1–I5 checked against an in-memory reference model
    after every simulated power loss; failures print the reproducing
    `(workload, P, mode, seed)` tuple. Runs in `cargo test` on all CI
    platforms. Verified to catch a deliberately injected missing-fsync bug.
- Project documentation: README, ROADMAP, DESIGN, file-format spec
  ([docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md)), testing strategy
  ([docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)), benchmark methodology
  ([docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)), contribution guide, security policy,
  ADRs ([docs/adr/](docs/adr/)).

### Changed
- Size NFR (honesty note, `docs/adr/0010`): the "< 40 MB incl. model" ceiling
  now governs the **compressed release artifact** users download (~20 MiB
  today), not the raw binary. The raw release binary is ~45 MiB because `ort`
  links ONNX Runtime statically (~23 MiB) on top of the embedded ~23 MiB model
  + tokenizer + code — ADR 0004 had assumed the model would dominate. No change
  to the "single self-contained file, no external dependency" promise.
